  "about_us_text_1": "We are a collaboration between the California State University of Los Angeles, local nonprofit agencies, and other institutions. We seek to increase financial capability, and ultimately financial well-being, of anyone who wishes to join us",
  "about_us_text_2": "ABC Membership is free and confidential. If you promise to share the information without judgment or advice, you will also receive a free Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Your Money, Your Goals (YMYG) toolkit and workbooks.

If you promise to share the information without judgment or advice, you will also receive a free Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Your Money, Your Goals toolkit and workbooks.",
  "about_us_text_3": "Latino families lost about two-thirds of their wealth in the Great Recession (Pew Research, 2011). Without intervention, African Americans will need 228 years and Latinos 84 years to accumulate the amount of wealth whites have today (Collins, Asante-Muhammed, Nieves, & Hoxie, 2016). Asset-building community products (e.g. matched savings accounts) can help rebuild this wealth. Yet it is challenging for service providers to recruit vulnerable clients to such programs (Padua and Doran, 2016). Over 90% of the annual federal asset building budget ($348 billion of $385 billion) is spent on tax deductions for the highest income earners, leaving little funding for public programs that help struggling families build wealth (Woo, Radamacher, Meier, 2010).  ABC strives to ease the path to financial well-being. We promote financial empowerment by guiding persons and institutions to local asset building programs and services.",
  "about_text_4": "The Asset Building Clinic is a collaboration between the California State University of Los Angeles, local nonprofit agencies, and other institutions.  We seek to enhance the financial well-being of anyone who wishes to join us by promoting financial capability through literacy and inclusion. We empower our members to act in their best financial interests by helping them teach themselves and others about financial products and services. Our members are encouraged to perform financially empowering acts with the ultimate goal of helping themselves as well as their communities build assets.",

Both giving and receiving are equally important -- you can’t share what you never learned. Paying ourselves is also important. Even the smallest rewards can shape habits. Since you don’t have to spend your points until you want to, you can be sure that whatever reward you choose will be one you love.",
  "as_we_seek_to_do": "As we seek to do more with less, the increasing complexity of our financial world can be daunting, if not overwhelming. What is a prepaid debit card, and does it matter it is not issued by a bank? Does overdraft protection really protect you from overdrafts? Is a car title loan a good option in a financial pinch? Are CDs a good investment?",
